/*
Description:
	Contains all the styles for the winning wheel page.

Verison History:
	2012-01-28
	- Created based off earlier version.

	2013-07-14
	- Changed font from arial to verdana so works nicely when example is displayed in site.
	- Added noCanvasMsg style so that the paragraph advising the user that their browser does not support canvas works correctly.
